                        I'm a 25 year-old graduate from Birmingham, UK with a passion for all things digital and visual.
                        I graduated with a degree in History from the University of Birmingham in 2017. During my degree, I 
                        spent a year abroad at the University of Malta, a country that will always hold a special place in 
                        my heart for its rich history and culture, beautiful landscapes, and the wonderful group of international
                        students I shared the experience with. <br><br>  
                    
                        Specialising in 20th century history, I researched cultural and social histories of the UK and 
                        the Middle East. Some of these research topics included Orientalism in photography, graffiti and 
                        urban change, gender in the Arab Spring, and a final year dissertation on the cultural production
                        surrounding the Brixton and Handsworth riots of the 1980s. <br><br>

                        Since graduating I have worked in the heritage sector. As an intern for the Commonwealth War Graves 
                        Commission, I worked as a tour guide in Ypres, Belgium and took part in several commemorative events
                        for the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele. After this, I worked in the retail department at 
                        the Tower of London for two years before deciding to move back to Birmingham during the pandemic to
                        focus on learning new skills to adapt to the changing job market. <br><br>

                        For this reason I decided to return to the University of Birmingham for the Coding Bootcamp course.
                        I wrote my first ever HTML and CSS code at the age of 13 but have since let my technical skills falter. 
                        I am working towards developing a strong portfolio of web projects, but in the meantime I have included on
                        <a class="text-light" href="portfolio.html">this page</a> a portfolio of my photography and graphic design projects I have pursued as a hobby over the years.
